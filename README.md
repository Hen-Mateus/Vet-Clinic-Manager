# VetClinic Manager App

This project was developed within the scope of the "Object-Oriented Programming" course. The VetClinic Manager App is a management application designed for a veterinary clinic. This solution was built using Windows Forms, .NET Framework, and C#, following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.

## Features:

• Management of Patients and Owners: A comprehensive system was developed to input and list patients (animals) along with their respective owners, ensuring organized and accessible information management.

• Registration of Veterinarians: The functionality to register veterinarians was implemented, enabling precise tracking of interventions performed by each professional.

• Scheduling Interventions: The application offers the ability to schedule different types of interventions, such as consultations, vaccinations, and surgeries, considering the veterinarian, type of animal, and type of intervention.

• Intelligent Cost Calculation: An intelligent system was developed to calculate the costs of interventions based on the type of animal, weight, and type of intervention, providing cost transparency to the animal owners.

• Consultations and Reports: Comprehensive consultation features were created, including patient listings, owner and veterinary intervention listings, animal incident history, and total cost calculations.

• Integration of Text Files: The system was implemented to read and write all data in text files, making the system versatile and accessible.

This project enhanced my proficiency in .NET Framework and C#, showcasing my dedication to applying Object-Oriented Programming to provide effective solutions. This application is a testament to my commitment to delivering comprehensive and tailored software solutions for each client.
